#netstat (network statistics) is a command line tool for monitoring network connections both incoming and outgoing as well as viewing routing tables, interface statistics etc. 
to check the listening ports and current(TCP) connection on a host 
(a) netstat -ano on window

#Vulnerability Scanners
+ There are a lot of vulnerability scanners out there,like OpenVAS,
Nexpose(https://www.rapid7.com/products/nexpose/) or 
GFI LAN Guard(http://www.gfi.com/products-and-solutions/network-security-solutions/gfi-languard)
Nessus(http://www.tenable.com/products/nessus)-most popular vulnerability scanners.                                                          

#Footprinting & Scanning
fping use for ping sweeps. "fping -a -g iprange"(a option for alive hosts and g option for ping sweeps)

#Web Server Fingerprinting
(a)Netcat(you will just use the default HTTP port:80)
nc <target address> 80
HEAD / HTTP/1.0
and hit return two times.
(b)OpenSSL(listens to HTTPS connecting)
openssl s_client -connect target.site:443
HEAD / HTTP/1.0
(c)Httprint(uses a signature-based technique to identify web servers)
httprint -P0 -h <target hosts> -s <signature file>
*-P0 to avoid pinging the host(most web servers do not response to ping echo requests)
